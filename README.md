# Bookstore-Management-using-MySQL

This project focuses on designing and implementing a MySQL-based database system for a retail bookstore. The project uses a books table as the core dataset and enhances it to support better data management, analytics, and reporting.

A secondary table, publishers, is added to normalize the schema and improve database structure.

The main objective of this project is to transform raw book data into meaningful insights that can support business decision-making. Through SQL queries, the system answers essential business questions such as:

Which books sell well or have high demand

How pricing influences availability

Which categories are most popular

How customer reviews relate to price and stock

How publishers contribute to inventory

This project demonstrates skills in data retrieval, aggregation, subqueries, CASE expressions, JOINs, updates, deletes, and schema normalization.
